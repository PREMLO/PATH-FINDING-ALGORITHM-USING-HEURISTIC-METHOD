# PATH-FINDING-ALGORITHM-USING-HEURISTIC-METHOD
### Description

This project is a Python-based grid navigation game using the Pygame library, designed to demonstrate pathfinding algorithms and heuristic functions. The user can interactively place the player and destination on a grid map and observe the shortest path calculated using the A* algorithm. The program incorporates two heuristic functions: the original Manhattan distance heuristic and an obstacle-aware heuristic that accounts for proximity to obstacles. Users can switch between these heuristics to see their effects on pathfinding. The graphical interface allows for visualizing the grid, obstacles, player movements, and the computed path.
